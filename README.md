# NativaTalk
Welcome to my first website project, **NativaTalk**, an innovative platform for learning foreign languages through native speakers. This project was completed during my 3rd semester of **Management Information System** class as a final project and it has been a great learning experience for me.

**NativaTalk** offers a wide range of languages, including **English**, **Japanese**, **German**, **Mandarin**, **French**, and **Russian**, catering to the diverse needs of language learners. Each language has five levels, from beginner to advanced, making it suitable for learners at different proficiency levels. The website is designed to provide an interactive and engaging learning experience, which is essential for language acquisition.

I focused on the front-end development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These technologies are the backbone of website development and I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with them. I also used **PHP** and **MySQL** for managing the back-end although the back-end is still far from perfect and incomplete, which helped me gain a better understanding of server-side programming. The website is also responsive, which means it can be opened on various devices. Lastly, the website is deployed and hosted using **GitHub Pages**.
